							<h1 class="major">Adjacent Beam Classifier (ABC) pipeline</h1>
                            <p> We used the UTMOST-NS interferometric system to find <a href="FRBs.html", target="_top">FRBs</a>. It had a field of view of 2.5 X 12.7 deg. This view was divided up into 192 beams (or pixels).</p>
                            <p>For the first time, in our search for FRBs, spatial information (dynamic spectrum from adjacent beams) was used in candidate classification. A celestial signal has a plane wavefront, and hence is present in just one of the beams. A Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) signal, which is just a false positive candidate that results from phone calls, however has a curved wavefront, and hence is present in multiple beams (see below). </p>

                            <p>Utilizing this information, a classification  model was implemented using a stream-processing framework that operates on GPUs as a block after a candidate production stage. It took ∼1.1 s to pre-process the data and to classify the candidates from each 2.7 s data-block (for 24 beams) on a GTX TITAN-12 GB GPU. A single evaluation from the CNN classifier took merely ∼1.9 ms (per candidate) with a 45 ms of pre-processing time. Hence the pipeline could perform classifications in near real-time.</p>

                            <p>The radio frequency data was chunked up across 8 GPU-enabled nodes for pre-processing. Each GPU enabled node thus processed 24 beams. Data blocks of dimension: 512 X 8192 X 24 (frequency samples X time samples X beams) are fed to a GPU on each node. Candidates for classification are fed through a pre-processing pipeline. For more information about the pre-processing steps, please refer to my <a href="https:// researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/file/8e23dc72-0e53-4645-9fd6-e44da85fadb6/1/ayushi_mandlik_thesis.pdf">thesis</a>! </p> 
                            <p>The pre-processed data is then sent to a CNN based classification system, with the information from the adjacent beams. It classified the candidate as an FRB or RFI.</p> 
                            <p>The final precision of the pipleline was 99.99%, with a recall of 100% for candidates with a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of greater than 15, 97% for
candidates with SNR between 10 to 15 and 80% for candidates with SNR between 8 to 10. </p>
