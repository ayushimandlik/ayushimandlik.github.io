							<h1 class="major">What is Customer Segmentation?</h1>
                            <p> Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a companyâ€™s customers into groups based on shared characteristicsâ€”like how often they buy, how much they spend, or how recently they made a purchase. </p>
                            <p> Instead of treating all customers the same, businesses use segmentation to understand different types of buyers. For example, some people buy frequently and spend a lot, while others might only make small purchases once in a while. Grouping these customers helps companies create more personalized marketing strategies.</p>
                            <h1 class="major" > Why is it Useful? </h1>
                            <p>Customer segmentation helps businesses answer questions like:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Who are my most valuable customers?</li>

                                <li>Which customers are at risk of leaving? </li>

                                <li> How can I better target different types of shoppers? </li>
                                <p> By understanding these patterns, companies can: </p>
                                <li> Offer loyalty rewards to their best customers </li>
                                <li>  Send re-engagement offers to inactive users</li>
                                <li>  Design special deals for frequent buyers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> Overall, segmentation is a simple but powerful way to make marketing and customer service more effective.</p>

                            <h1 class="major">Project overview </h1>
                            <p>
                            For this project, I used a publicly available online retail dataset that contains over 90,000 transactions between December 2010 and December 2011. The dataset comes from a UK-based non-store online retailer that sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many of the companyâ€™s customers are wholesalers. Dataset Source: Online Retail Data Set, UCI Machine Learning Repository.  <a   href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail">Link</a> </p>
                            <p> Each row in the dataset represents a transaction and includes the following features: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> InvoiceNo: Unique invoice number (invoices starting with 'C' are cancellations)</li>
                                <li> StockCode: Product/item code</li>
                                <li> Description: Product name </li>
                                <li> Quantity: Quantity of the item purchased</li>
                                <li> InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction</li>
                                <li> UnitPrice: Price per unit (in Sterling)</li>

                                <li> CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer </li>
                                <li> Country: Customer's country of residence </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h1>Project pipeline </h1>
                                <p>Here is a high-level overview of the steps I followed in this project: </p>
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/cust_seg_pipeline.png" alt="Image showing steps followed in the project." /></span>
                                <p> To understand customer behavior, I focused on building RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features using the transaction data. These metrics are commonly used in marketing and customer analytics: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase </li>
                                    <li> Frequency: How often they purchase </li>
                                    <li> Monetary: How much they spend </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p> Based on the RFM features, the customers were clustered using KMeans clustering into 4 groups. These included loyal, high-spending customers; regular shoppers with moderate frequency; price-sensitive or less engaged customers; and at-risk customers who haven't made purchases in a while. These insights can help businesses personalize marketing, re-engage inactive users, or reward loyal buyers.</p>
